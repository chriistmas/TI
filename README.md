# TI

TI is a web-based map application that visualizes and manages public transportation routes using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and GeoJSON data. The project allows users to explore different routes, view stops, and interact with a map interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Visualize transportation routes and stops on a map.
- **Route Selection**: Choose from multiple available routes.
- **GeoJSON Data**: Uses `.geojson` files to represent stops and route points.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Some routes use KML data for compatibility.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily show or hide routes, clear the map, and explore different transport lines.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
